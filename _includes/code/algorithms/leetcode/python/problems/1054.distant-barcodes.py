# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,2,2,2]'
#
# In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the i^th barcode is
# barcodes[i].
# 
# Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may
# return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
# Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]
# Example 2:
# Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000
# 1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def rearrangeBarcodes(self, barcodes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
