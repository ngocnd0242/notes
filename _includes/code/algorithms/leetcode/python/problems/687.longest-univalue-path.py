#
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where
# each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass
# through the root.
# 
# The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of
# edges between them.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,5]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,5]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# The depth of the tree will not exceed 1000.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def longestUnivaluePath(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
