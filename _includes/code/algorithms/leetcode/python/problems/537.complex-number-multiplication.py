#
# 
# Given two strings representing two complex numbers.
# 
# 
# You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i^2 = -1
# according to the definition.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
# Output: "0+2i"
# Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i^2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert
# it to the form of 0+2i.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
# Output: "0+-2i"
# Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i^2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert
# it to the form of 0+-2i.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The input strings will not have extra blank.
# The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and
# b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also
# in this form.
