#
# The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 
# 
# T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.
# 
# Given n, return the value of Tn.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
# T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 25
# Output: 1389537
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= n <= 37
# The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. answer <= 2^31 -
# 1.
