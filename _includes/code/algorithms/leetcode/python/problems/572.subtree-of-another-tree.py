# Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly
# the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a
# tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s
# could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
# 
# Example 1:
# Given tree s:
# 
# 
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   / \
# ⁠  4   5
# ⁠ / \
# ⁠1   2
# 
# Given tree t:
# 
# 
# ⁠  4 
# ⁠ / \
# ⁠1   2
# 
# Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree
# of s.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Given tree s:
# 
# 
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   / \
# ⁠  4   5
# ⁠ / \
# ⁠1   2
# ⁠   /
# ⁠  0
# 
# Given tree t:
# 
# 
# ⁠  4
# ⁠ / \
# ⁠1   2
# 
# Return false.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSubtree(self, s: TreeNode, t: TreeNode) -> bool:
