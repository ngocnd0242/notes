 * Testcase Example:  '[["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]]\n' +
  '["oath","pea","eat","rain"]'
 *
 * Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all
 * words on the board.
 * 
 * Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
 * where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
 * letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board =
 * [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]],
 * words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
 * Output: ["eat","oath"]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 12
 * board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
 * 1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
 * words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of words are unique.
